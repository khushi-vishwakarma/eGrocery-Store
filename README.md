# eGrocery-Store
A grocery store is a retail store that sells food mainly. Large grocery stores that stock products other than food such as clothing or household items. 
The global pandemic brought online platforms to centre stage for grocers. India is witnessing a surge in demand for online grocery.
I created static eGrocery website by using only HTML and CSS. It's not a fully responsive website its like a presentation and we can make it 
fully responsive and real website by using Js. Credit - Youtube and Google.
