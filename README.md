# eGrocery-Store
A grocery store is a retail store that sells food mainly. Large grocery stores that stock products other than food such as clothing or household items. 
The global pandemic brought online platforms to centre stage for grocers. Online grocery sales were  growing and the segment was becoming an increasingly important part of grocery's future.
I make this website by using only html and css. So it is not a fully responsive website. It's just a type of presentation in which we can add more things and make it real by using js.
Hope you liked it:)
